# Ensure we don't ignore useful vscode config if intended, but usually personal settings are ignored.
# For an extension, launch.json and tasks.json are often useful to share, so let's KEEP them commenting them out in ignore or just ignoring .vscode/* but keeping specific ones.
# Actually, standard `yo code` keeps launch.json.
# Let's ignore the folder but keep the config files if they are generic.
